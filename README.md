# Travel2Go

This app allows a user to search for a city they wish to travel to and then select and view their favourite tourist attractions. This app also allows the user to search for
hire car options for specific dates.

## Instructions

1. Start typing the name of a city in the search box, i.e. London. As you start typing, you will notice the suggestions for the city name. Once the city name is entered, click on search.

2. You will then see a list of top tourist categories appear at the bottom as buttons.

3. Click on the preferred button, this will display the child category buttons underneath.

4. When you click on a child category button, this will display the places associated with that category on the page.

5. Details include: name, address, opening times, website etc.

6. If you wish to book a hire car, you can do so my navigating to the hire car tab and then selecting a pick up and drop off date. When you click search, you can view the car options available to you including the cost of the hire and details about the vehicle.

7. There is also a enquiry form for the user to complete and submit which they can do with their query.
